# Fitness Friend

Our project Fitness Friend, is an iOS app that aims to provide users a simple platform to organize and keep track of their workouts. Fitness Friend focuses on simplicity and motivation, allowing users to view if they have exercised today and track their goals. 

## Code Structure

Under the `FitnessFriend`, the code structure is broken down as follows:

- `Cells`: This is where the table cell for cardio and power lifting inputs are defined to appear on the home page.
- `Screens`: This is where each page is stored: Home page, Input page, and User Profile page, along with the tab view of the app.
- `Views`: This is where specific views uses throughout the app are defined such as textfields, section headers, and alerts.
- `Models`: Where information for cardio and powerlifitng workouts are stored, along with the user profile.
